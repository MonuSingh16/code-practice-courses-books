1. Split players in odd and even team using slice method of list. odd_team - [1::2], from 1 to each jump of two places, even_team[::2], from 0 to each jump of 2 places. 
2. Profanity from list of messages. Count profane words in a message, remove them.  Missing ingredients  from a recipe and percentage of missing ingredients from a recipe. or wrongly ordered ingredients from the recipe. Incorrect path taken by a character from a list of ordered path. for i in range(len(path)) : if exp_path[i] == char_path[i]: count += 1. Double the String - For each character in string, char * 2 and add it to the empty string,

1. I recommend using an f-string to create the id field. This is a best practice. 
2. You can't have two of the same key in the same dictionary. If you try to use the same key twice, the first value will simply be overwritten. 
3. If you're unsure whether or not a key exists in a dictionary, use the in keyword. 
4. When you're trying to find a "max" value, it helps to keep track of the "max so far" in a variable . max_so_far = float("-inf"). Merge 2 dictionary by indexing on the key within the for loop.

1. Sets are like Lists, but they are unordered and they guarantee uniqueness. Only ONE of each value can be in a set. Use .set() function to create an empty set. Use .add() to add item to set, if an item already exist, it will not throw error.
2. You've been hired by a blogging company and they are asking you to analyze one of their recent posts to determine the number of vowels present in their paragraphs.

1. Factorial Function - 
2. Complete the area_sum() function. It accepts a list of rectangles, where each rectangle is a dictionary that has the following structure:
3. Complete the fizzbuzz function that loops over all the numbers from start to end (excluding the end value) and adds them to a list it returns. If the number is a multiple of 3, instead of appending the number, append "fizz". If the number is a multiple of 5, instead append "buzz". If it is a multiple of 3 and 5 then instead append "fizzbuzz".
4. Write a function called divide_list() that takes a list and a number as input. The function returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list except they have been divided by the second input.
5. Write a function called join_strings() that takes a list of strings and returns a single string. Concatenate the strings from the list end-to-end, in order, with a comma between them. Don't use the .join() string method
